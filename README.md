# Movie_Recommendation_System
This is a content-based movie recommendation system I developed using Python and scikit-learn. The goal was to suggest movies based on a user’s preferences—particularly focusing on genre and mood. I used Count Vectorizer to analyze movie metadata and applied cosine similarity to find and rank similar movies.
